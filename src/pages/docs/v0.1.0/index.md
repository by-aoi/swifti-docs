# Swifti Docs

> Efficient and minimalist web framework based on folders and files.

Swifti is a web framework designed to be minimalist and easy to use, taking as a reference other frameworks that work using a folder structure for the different application paths.

With Swifti you can create API server applications in a friendly and comfortable way, in addition to providing good performance by not having unnecessary functions, but, in turn, you can increase their complexity using community middlewares.

Additionally, Swifti can be used with or without typescript, giving you the freedom to use your favorite language.
